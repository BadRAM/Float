# How this Project Began

This project began when someone in the BetterDiscord server posted this.
![Inspiration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73869003/150845131-88987663-e5cc-4a01-82ca-eabd9186cce0.png)

I was very interested in this, so I decided to start developing something similar. Thank you Disease for posting this.

# How this theme works

This theme was made using pure css and a couple BetterDiscord settings. 

# Installing Float

## BetterDiscord
- Install [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/).
- [Download Float from the raw](https://cedrickzedd.github.io/Float/Float.theme.css). Right click the page and click `Save as`, then move the `Float.theme.css` file into the BetterDiscord theme directory. Enable the theme.

In the BetterDiscord settings, scroll down to WINDOW PREFERENCES and enable `Remove Minimum Size`. Optional: enable `Enable Transparency` to use background transparency.

## Powercord
- Install [Powercord](https://powercord.dev/).
- Open a command prompt and enter:
```
cd powercord/src/Powercord/themes && git clone https://github.com/cedrickzedd/Float
```
**Note: Powercord does not have Remove Minimum Size setting.**

## Always on Top function
- Install [Powertoys by Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys#microsoft-powertoys).

In the Powertoys settings, enable `Always On Top` and set a keybind: Default: `âŠž Win + CTRL + T`.

# Help! THeME No WOrk, It BRoCkeN

Join my [Support Server](https://discord.gg/BpwYF5UyHu) if you need help with installation, if you find theme bugs, if you want to contribute and help clean the code, join for future updates or future themes / plugins, etc.

**DO NOT PING ME OR ASK FOR SUPPORT ON MY THEME IN THE BETTERDISCORD SERVER (OR THE POWERCORD SERVER) AS THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL THEME, AND YOU WILL NOT FIND SUPPORT THERE**
